        People
    </h1>
    
    <p>
        People are weird.<br>
        They can make your day or take your smile away.<br>
        <br>
        People are strange.<br>
        They'll invite conversation yet have nothing to say.<br>
       <br>
        People are confusing.<br>
        They'll say one thing, but mean and want another.<br>
        <br>
        People are difficult.<br>
        I can never figure out if we like each other.<br>
        <br>
        People are worrying<br>
        I can rarely interpret the meaning of their tone.<br>
        <br>
        People scare me.<br>
        But it scares me even more to be left all alone.
