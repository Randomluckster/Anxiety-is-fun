    <h1>
        Home
    </h1>
    <p>
        Home should be safety, and home should be calm.<br>
        A place to relax and take shelter from the storm.<br>
        It should offer comfort and a space to mellow out.<br>
        A place to let go of any worry, fear and doubt.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yet in spite of this, at times, home can feel so wrong.<br>
        Cold, dark and strange, as the pressure creeps in strong.<br>
        A place of isolation where one can feel so very alone.<br>
        It may not seem too welcoming, but I choose to call it home.
