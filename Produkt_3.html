        Fun
    </h1>
    <p>
        Should fun be fun?<br>
        That's what one would assume.<br>
        But fun is not fun,<br>
        when one feels trapped in the room.<br>
        <br>
        It takes away your breath,<br>
        to be pressured by your peers.<br>
        Though they don't choose to cause it,<br>
        they amplify your fears.<br>
        <br>
        All surroundings cause great stress,<br>
        and you wish to just be free.<br>
        So is fun even fun?<br>
        That'd be nice, if you ask me.
