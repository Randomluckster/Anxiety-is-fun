    <p>
        Why when I feel like I'm having fun<br>
        do I then feel like I'm too close the sun?<br>
        And how come when someone puts me in the photo frame<br>
        do I then feel insurmountable shame?<br>
        <br>
        Why is it when i feel that I'm doing alright<br>
        that I also feel incredible fright.<br>
        And why is it when I see that there are good things ahead<br>
        that I also feel horrible dread.?<br>
        <br>
        Sometimes I just wish that these thoughts I could flee<br>
        but that's just not an option when my mind works against me.
